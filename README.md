# Cyclistic-Project
Cyclistic is a company that offers bike-share services. The bikes are geo-tracked and can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime. Cyclistic runs a flexible pricing plan that offers single-ride passes, full-day passes and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders, while customers who purchase annual memberships are referred to as Cyclistic Members. 
The business has decided to increase the number of Cyclistic Members as a strategy for growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign targeting all new customers, the Marketing Director believes there is a good chance to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.
## Scenario 
To better understand the customer so that the appropriate marketing programs can be designed, the Marketing director has asked me to analyse the ride data and present insights that will guide marketing activities. The data analysis should answer the following questions. 
#### How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
#### Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
## The Dataset
The data set contained 12 months from July 2022 to June 2023. The dataset was separated into monthly files containing 13 columns covering ride_ID, bike_type, start date & time, end date & time, start station name, start station ID, end station name, end station ID, start latitude, start longitude, end latitude, end longitude and customer type.
